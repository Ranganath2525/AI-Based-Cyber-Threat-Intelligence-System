prompt_text = f"""You are an AI assistant specializing in digital media analysis.
        A specialized local model has analyzed the provided content and its verdict is "{verdict.upper()}".

        Your task is to provide a brief, bullet-point explanation for this verdict based on the CONTENTS of the media/text itself.
        Examine the content for common artifacts or characteristics that align with the local model's verdict.
        Your goal is to be descriptive and helpful, not just to repeat the confidence score.

        Here are examples of the kind of descriptive analysis I want:
        - For a FAKE image of Tom Cruise on Iron Man, you might say: "- The lighting on Tom Cruise's face does not match the metallic reflections from the suit. - There are blurring artifacts around the jawline."
        - For a FAKE audio, you might say: "- A slight metallic or robotic tone can be heard. - The speaker's breathing patterns sound unnatural."
        - For a Phishing email, you might say: "- The email creates a false sense of urgency. - The sender's address does not match the company's official domain."
        - For a REAL video, you might say: "- The lip movements sync naturally with the audio. - Shadows and lighting appear consistent. or Tom Cruise on Iron Man, you might say: "- The lighting on Tom Cruise's face does not match the metallic reflections from the suit. - There are blurring artifacts around the jawline."

        Now, provide your analysis for the following:
        
        Analysis Type: {analysis_type}
        Local Model Verdict: "{verdict.upper()}"
        Local Model Data: {json.dumps(result_data_for_prompt)}
        """
